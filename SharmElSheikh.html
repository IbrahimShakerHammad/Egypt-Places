						Sharm El Sheikh, commonly abbreviated to Sharm,
						is an Egyptian city on the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula, in South Sinai Governorate, 
						on the coastal strip along the Red Sea. Its population is approximately 53,670 as of 2022. 
						Sharm El Sheikh is the administrative hub of Egypt's South Sinai Governorate, 
						which includes the smaller coastal towns of Dahab and Nuweiba as well as the mountainous interior, 
						St. Catherine and Mount Sinai. The city and holiday resort is a significant centre for tourism in Egypt, 
						while also attracting many international conferences and diplomatic meetings. Sharm El Sheikh is one of the Asian cities of Egypt, 
						it's also called (The city of peace).
					</p>
					<p>
						Lampposts on El Salaam Street use solar power. Taxis and buses are numbered for safety.
						Sharm's marina has been redeveloped for private yachts and sailing boats, with a passenger terminal for cruise ships.
						The city is served by Sharm El Sheikh International Airport, the third largest airport in Egypt.
						Sharm has frequent coach services to Cairo leaving from the Delta Sharm bus station.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sharm El Sheikh has become a popular location for scuba diving as a result of its underwater scenery and warm waters. Other beach activities include snorkeling, windsurfing, kite-surfing, para-sailing, boating, and canoeing.
						Ras Muhammad National Park is located at the southernmost tip of the Sinai Peninsula where the waters of the Red Sea and Gulf of Suez meet, producing strong currents and providing a habitat for diverse marine life. Two reefs popular with divers are Shark Reef, a vertical wall descending to over 800 metres (2,600 ft), and Yolanda Reef, the site of the wreck of the Yolanda.
						The Straits of Tiran are located at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba and in a major shipping lane. There are four reefs there, each named after one of the British cartographers who first mapped them: Gordan, Thomas, Woodhouse and Jackson. In summer months, hammerhead sharks swim in schools near the reefs.
						The Sharm El Sheikh Hyperbaric Medical Center was founded in 1993 by the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism with a grant from USAID, to assist with diving-related medical conditions.
