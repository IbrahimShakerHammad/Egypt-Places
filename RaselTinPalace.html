					<p>
						Ras El Tin Palace is a palace on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea in Alexandria, Egypt. 
						It is one of the official residences for a serving President of Egypt. 
						Under the Muhammad Ali Dynasty of Egypt and Sudan, it was a royal palace. 
						Ras El Tin Palace is the oldest royal Egyptian palace still in use.
					</p>
					<p>
						The palace is located in the Ras el-Tin quarter of Alexandria overlooking the city's Western Harbour.
						It was built on a promontory which in antiquity had been the site of the island of Pharos.
						The palace has a long historical association with Egyptian royalty.
						It is one of few palaces in Egypt to witness the initiation of the long-lasting Muhammad Ali dynasty by Muhammad Ali Pasha (r. 1805â€“1848) during the early 19th century.
						A number of foreign architects and engineers were commissioned by Muhammad Ali for the design and construction of the palace.
						Building activities began in 1834, taking eleven years to complete the original design in 1845.
						Complementary work and the construction of additional wings continued for two more years until 1847,
						when it was officially inaugurated.
