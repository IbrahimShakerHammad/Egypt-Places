						The Mosque-Madrasa of Sultan Hasan is a monumental mosque and madrasa located in Salah al-Din Square in the historic district of Cairo, Egypt. It was built between 1356 and 1363 during the Bahri Mamluk period, commissioned by Sultan an-Nasir Hasan. The mosque was considered remarkable for its massive size and innovative architectural components, and is still considered one of the most impressive historic monuments in Cairo today.

						Sultan al-Nasir Hasan ascended the throne at the age of 13 in 748 AH/1347 CE.
						When he reached maturity in 1350, he arrested the Emir Manjaq who controlled all of the state's affairs. 
						Prior to that arrest, the emir was restricted to an allowance of just one hundred dirham per day. 
						This pocket change was collected by servants for the Sultan. 
						It's especially striking considering that during that time, 
						the emir Shaykhu was estimated to have an income of 200,000 dirham per day. 
						This deprivation may be viewed as a prompt for his later extravagance. Upon taking over the reins, 
						Sultan Hasan placed people of his own favor into positions of power. 
						This happened at the expense of dignitaries currently in position; 
						it upset many of them. Discontented Emirs arrested the Sultan in 1351, 
						held him in jail for three years, and promoted his brother as-Salih Salih to the throne. 
						Hasan spent his time in jail studying and his obituaries commented on his learning as a result. 
						He returned to power and again reshuffled the ruling establishment attempting to solidify power, 
						but Sultan Hasan was assassinated by his commander in chief of the army, Yalbugha al-Umari, 
						a Mamluk thought to be loyal. 
						Because of the Sultan's extravagance in spending fortunes on women and other forms of favoritism, 
						the commander rebelled against the Sultan. A contemporary Syrian historian, Ibn Kathir, backed this reputation. 
						Ibn Kathir blamed the sultan for his greed and squandering of public funds. 
						The lavish expenses noted coincide with the Sultan's extensive mosque. 
						After his assassination in 1361, Sultan Hasan's body was never found; the mausoleum never served its purpose.
