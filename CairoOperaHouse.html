					<p>
						The Cairo Opera House, 
						part of Cairo's National Cultural Centre, 
						is the main performing arts venue in the Egyptian capital. 
						Home to most of Egypt's finest musical groups, 
						it is located on the southern portion of Gezira Island in the Nile River, 
						in the Zamalek district near downtown Cairo.
					</p>
					<p>
						The opera house was inaugurated on 10 October 1988. 
						The funds for the complex were a gift from the nation of Japan to Egypt as a result of President Hosni Mubarak's visit to Japan in April 1983. 
						Construction began in May 1985 and lasted for three years.
						In October 1988, President Mubarak and Prince Tomohito of Mikasa, 
						the younger brother of the Japanese Emperor, inaugurated the National Cultural Centre Cairo Opera House. 
						It was the first time for Japan to stage a Kabuki show, a traditional popular drama with singing and dancing, 
						in Africa or the Arab World.
						In recognition of the Cairo Opera House, 
						the London Royal Philharmonic Orchestra chose it as a venue for their first performance in the Middle East and Africa in January 2007. 
						The Arabic Oud House was created in its premises before moving to a building in the old town.
