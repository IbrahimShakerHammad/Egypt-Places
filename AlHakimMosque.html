					<p>
						The Mosque of al-Hakim is a historic mosque in Cairo, Egypt. 
						It is named after Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah (985â€“1021), the sixth Fatimid caliph and 16th Ismaili Imam. 
						Construction of the mosque was originally started by Caliph al-'Aziz, the son of al-Mu'izz and the father of al Hakim, 
						in 990 AD. It was completed in 1013 by al-Hakim, which is why it is named after him.
					</p>
					<p>
						The mosque is located in Islamic Cairo, on the east side of al-Mu'izz Street, just south of Bab al-Futuh (the northern city gate). In the centuries since its construction the mosque was often neglected and re-purposed for other functions, eventually falling into ruin. A major restoration and reconstruction of the mosque by the Dawoodi Bohras was completed in 1980, reopening it for religious use.
