					<p>
						Avenue of Sphinxes or The King's Festivities Road, 
						also known as Rams Road is a 2.7 km (1.7 mi) long avenue (dromos) which connects Karnak Temple with Luxor Temple having been uncovered in the ancient city of Thebes (modern Luxor), 
						with sphinxes and ram-headed statues lined up on both flanks.
					</p>
					<p>
						Construction of the Avenue of Sphinxes began during the New Kingdom era and was completed during the Late period during the reign of 30th Dynasty ruler Nectanebo I (380–362 B.C.), 
						the road was later buried under layers of sand over the centuries.
						In Description de l'Égypte (1809) the Avenue of Sphinxes is described as 2,000 meters long, 
						lined with over 600 sphinxes.
						Georges Daressy reported in 1893 that at Luxor the road is buried and couldn't be excavated because it lay below the groundwater level, 
						whereas at Karnak nearly a kilometer of it is visible.
						The first trace of the avenue (at Luxor) was found in 1949 when Egyptian archaeologist Mohammed Zakaria Ghoneim discovered eight statues near the Luxor Temple with 17 more statues uncovered from 1958 to 1961 and 55 unearthed from 1961 to 1964 all within a perimeter of 250 meters. From 1984 to 2000, the entire route of the walkway was finally determined, leaving it to excavators to uncover the road. The original 1,057 statues are along the way, and they are divided into three shapes.
