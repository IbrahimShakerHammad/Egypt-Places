					<p>
						The Mausoleum of Aga Khan is the mausoleum of Aga Khan III, Sir Sultan Muhammed Shah, who died in 1957. 
						The mausoleum is located at Aswan along the Nile of Egypt, since Egypt was formerly the centre of power of the Fatimids,
						an Ismaili Shia dynasty.
						The construction of the mausoleum began in 1956 and ended in 1960. 
						The Aga Khan's wife, Begum Om Habibeh Aga Khan, commissioned the construction of the mausoleum, 
						which initially accepted tourists inside; however, the interior was closed off to the public in 1997.
						A red rose is laid on the Aga Khan's tomb every day practice first started by Begum Om Habibeh Aga Khan.

						Egyptian architect Farid Shafi'e (1907-1985) designed the mausoleum, 
						who during his career served as an architectural designer; 
						professor and director of the architecture department at Cairo University; 
						and consultant for the King Abdulaziz University, among other roles.
						Among some of the other buildings that Farid Shafie designed during his career are the headquarters of the Royal Navy in Cairo;
						the Office of the Sheikh at the Al-Azhar Mosque; and a royal suite in the Abdeen Palace in Cairo.
						Farid Shafi'e published numerous journal articles and books during his career, 
						including an article about the Masjid al-Juyushi, the Fatimid building that the Mausoleum of Aga Khan III was designed to resemble.
						Some of Shafi'e's other publications include Characteristics of Decorated Wood in the Abbasid and Fatimid Styles (1954); 
						Arabic Islamic Architecture: Its Past, Present and Future (1981); and Arab Architecture in Islamic Egypt, 
						Volume 2: The Fatimid Era (1982). 
						Shafi'e's past publications indicate that he had studied Fatimid architecture extensively prior to designing the Mausoleum of Aga Khan III.
