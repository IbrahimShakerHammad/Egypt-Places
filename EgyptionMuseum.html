					<p>
						The Museum of Egyptian Antiquities, known commonly as the Egyptian Museum or the Cairo Museum, 
						in Cairo, Egypt, is home to an extensive collection of ancient Egyptian antiquities. It has 120,000 items, 
						with a representative amount on display and the remainder in storerooms. Built in 1901 by the Italian construction company, 
						Garozzo-Zaffarani, to a design by the French architect Marcel Dourgnon, 
						the edifice is one of the largest museums in the region. As of March 2019, the museum was open to the public. 
						In 2022, the museum is due to be superseded by the newer and larger Grand Egyptian Museum at Giza.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are two main floors in the museum, the ground floor and the first floor. 
						On the ground floor there is an extensive collection of large-scale works in stone including statues, 
						reliefs and architectural elements. These are arranged chronologically in clockwise fashion, 
						from the pre-dynastic to the Greco-Roman period. The first floor is dedicated to smaller works, 
						including papyri, coins, textiles, and an enormous collection of wooden sarcophagi. 
						The numerous pieces of papyrus are generally small fragments, owing to their decay over the past two millennia. 
						Several languages are found on these pieces, including Greek, Latin, Arabic, and ancient Egyptian. 
						The coins found on this floor are made of many different metals, including gold, silver, and bronze. 
						The coins are not only Egyptian, but also Greek, Roman, and Islamic. 
						This has helped historians research the history of Ancient Egyptian trade.
					</p>
					<p>
						Also on the ground floor are artifacts from the New Kingdom, the time period between 1550 and 1069 BC. 
						These artifacts are generally larger than items created in earlier centuries. Those items include statues, 
						tables, and coffins (sarcophagi). It contains 42 rooms; upon entering through the security check in the building, 
						one looks toward the atrium and the rear of the building with many items on view from sarcophagi and boats to enormous statues.
						On the first floor there are artifacts from the final two dynasties of Egypt, 
						including items from the tombs of the Pharaohs; Thutmosis III, Thutmosis IV, Amenophis II, Hatshepsut, 
						and the courtier Maiherpri, as well as many artifacts from the Valley of the Kings, 
						in particular the material from the intact tombs of Tutankhamun and Psusennes I. 
						Two special rooms contain a number of mummies of kings and other royal family members of the New Kingdom. 
						On April 3, 2021, twenty-two of these mummies were transferred to the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Fustat in a grand parade dubbed The Pharaohs' Golden Parade.
