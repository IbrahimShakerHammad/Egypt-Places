					<p>
						Bab Zuweila or Bab Zuwayla is one of three remaining gates in the city wall of the Old City of Cairo, 
						the capital of Egypt. It was also known as Bawabbat al-Mitwali during the Ottoman period. 
						It is considered one of the major landmarks of the city and is the last remaining southern gate from the walls of Fatimid-era Cairo in the 11th and 12th century.
					</p>
					<p>
						The city of Cairo was founded in 969 as the royal city of the Fatimid dynasty. In 1092, 
						the vizier Badr al-Jamali had a second wall built around Cairo. Bab Zuweila was the southern gate in this wall. 
						It has twin towers (minarets) which can be accessed via a steep climb. 
						In earlier times they were used to scout for enemy troops in the surrounding countryside, and in modern times, 
						they provide views of Old Cairo.
						The structure also has a platform. Executions would sometimes take place there, 
						and it was also from this location that the Sultan would stand to watch the beginning of the hajj, 
						the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. Sometimes the severed heads of criminals would be displayed along the tops of the walls. 
						This was done as recently as 1811, when the severed heads of Mamluks from the Citadel massacre were mounted on spikes here.
						The corresponding gate on the northern side of the city was the Bab al-Futuh, which still stands on the northern side of the Muizz street.
