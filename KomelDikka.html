						Kom El Deka, also known as Kom el-Dikka, is a neighborhood and archaeological site in Alexandria, Egypt. 
						Early Kom El-Dikka was a well-off residential area, and later it was a major civic center in Alexandria, 
						with a bath complex (thermae), auditoria (lecture halls), and a theatre. Today, 
						Kom el-Dikka is the largest and most complete above ground archeological site in Alexandria. 
						It provides large amounts of archeological evidence of urban life in Roman Egypt, 
						including early villas and their mosaics, and late Roman public works.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Early Roman Period, dating from the 1st-3rd century AD, contains the earliest well preserved structures. 
						In this period, Kom el-Dikka contained mainly large villas. In the late 3rd century, 
						the area was badly damaged by a combination of Palmyrene invasion, Aurelian’s siege, and Diocletian’s repressions.
						The Late Roman-Byzantine Period, dating from the 4th-7th century, saw a very changed neighborhood. 
						Public works replaced private houses, and the site was notably dominated by a large imperial bath complex,
						as well as a theater and a series of auditoria. These public works were constructed together,
						and were intertwined in their construction. With these buildings, 
						Kom el-Dikka served as a major civic center in Alexandria.
