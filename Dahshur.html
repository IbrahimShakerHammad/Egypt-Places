					<p>
						Dahshur is an ancient Egyptian pyramid complex and necropolis and shares the name of the nearby village of Manshiyyat Dahshur in markaz Badrashin, Giza.
						Dahshur is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, 
						and is located on the Western Desert plateau at the edge of the cultivated plain, 
						and along with the pyramid complexes at Saqqara, Abusir, and Giza, to its north, 
						forms the pyramid fields of the ancient capital city of Memphis.
						It is known chiefly for several pyramids, mainly Senefru's Bent Pyramid and Red Pyramid, 
						which are among the oldest, largest and best preserved in Egypt, built from 2613 to 2589 BC.
					</p>
					<p>
						Located closely to the pyramid of the 12th Dynasty several undisturbed tombs of royal women were found, 
						containing a large amount of lapidary and jewelry that have been determined to be of the highest stage of metalworking in Egypt during this time period.
						The pyramid of Senusret III was part of a huge complex, with several smaller pyramids of royal women, 
						along with another pyramid to the south. 
						In a gallery tomb next to this pyramid were found two treasures of the king's daughters (Sithathor).
						Extensive cemeteries of officials of the Old Kingdom and Middle Kingdom have been found around Dahshur's pyramids. 
						Dahshur was Egypt's royal necropolis during the reign of the 12th Dynasty king Amenemhat II.
